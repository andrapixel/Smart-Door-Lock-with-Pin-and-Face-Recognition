# Smart-Door-Lock-with-Pin-and-Face-Recognition
An Arduino team project for the "Design with Microprocessors" course. 
This project simulates a smart door lock system that opens only when given the correct pin, or when the person facing the door is recognized. The main project that is controlling the physical components is written in Arduino, while Python is used to handle the face recognition part of the system.
